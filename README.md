## General Information
- The year 2020 was a catastrophic year for humanity. Pneumonia of unknown aetiology was first reported in December 2019., since then, COVID-19 spread to 
the whole world and became a global pandemic. More than 200 countries were affected due to pandemic and many countries were trying to save precious lives 
of their people by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, social distances, event postponements and lockdowns to prevent the spread of the virus. However, due to lackadaisical attitude, efforts attempted by the governments were jeopardised, thus, predisposing to the wide spread of virus and lost of lives. 
Hence, the usage of deep learning model to predict the daily is proposed. COVID cases to determine if travel bans should be imposed or rescinded.
